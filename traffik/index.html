<h1>The Ride Against Traffik</h1>
<div class="intro">
  <p>In February 2019, 4 of us travelled from London to Delhi to join the Viva team and begin the challenge of riding one of the major traffiking routes, against the flow of young girls being bought and sold between Kathmandu and Delhi. The aim of the challenge, to raise awareness and <a href="https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/TimMullender" >funds</a> to help Viva in preventing the traffik and restoring the lives of those involved.</p>

  <div class="description">
    <p>We arrived in Delhi around 9am, Gary met us at the airport with Nirendra, the driver and the 4x4 that was to be our transport for the fortnight.  We wheeled the luggage out to the car park, located the vehicle and started to workout how to get everything in. Magically 3 or 4 men appeared, who seemed to profess some level of expertise in loading vehicles, offering their assistance and within 10 minutes it was established that the bikes would fit in with Gary and Nirendra and the four of us would get a taxi to the hotel.The taxi was a squeeze, but it was only a 40 minute drive and a good introduction to the roads of Delhi</p>
    <p> I don&#39;t think more than 30 seconds passed without hearing a car horn the whole time we were in Delhi.  We arrived at the hotel a bit tired and, as only one room was available initially, set about reconstructing the bikes. There had only been one minor issue in transit, Dave&#39;s bike had arrived with a broken QR skewer, thankfully we had a spare so after a couple of hours of assembling and checking we were good to go.Our rooms were ready just in time for a quick shower, a bite to eat and then we got to meet some of the Viva team in India.</p>
    <p>Viva India had been spending the last few days in the hotel getting together the leaders from the various centres around India to discuss strategy and encourage each other.  They spent about an hour telling us about each of the regions they worked in and the many ways in which they were helping children in those areas, it was good to hear the great work they are doing. After the session there was time for a quick but necessary snooze before heading out for tea with some of the Viva team.  We headed to a restaurant round the corner from the hotel, where they proceeded to repeatedly bring delicious food and place it on our plates for at least 20 minutes before telling us that was just the starter and the main course was a buffet so we could help ourselves. Needless to say I think I stocked up well for the next day. When we finally made it back to the hotel and into bed I think I was asleep in seconds.</p>

    <p>The alarms went off soon after 5am, showers were had, sun cream was applied, cycling kit was donned and bags were packed. Rooms were emptied, breakfast was eaten, the vehicle was packed and bikes were readied, all before 6am (mostly).  The plan was to be out of Delhi before the traffic got bad, so shortly before 7, after a prayer and a goodbye from the members of the Viva team that were awake, Gary led the way out of the hotel parking area onto the road.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gn8AW4oC1Xc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>We waited for the 4x4 to catch up before winding our way on to the main road that would take us out of Delhi, the sun was just starting to rise and the city was starting to come to life. Nervousness was the pervasive feeling, unknown roads, unknown rules and an unknown destination with the added thought of only having put the bikes together a few hours earlier on very little sleep made the intial miles somewhat tentative.</p>
    <p>We very quickly had to adapt to the "rules" of the road, for me that could be summed up by "Don't hit what's in front of you and what's behind you will take care of itself", it lead to one of the more memorable phrases from the trip "Incoming!" (said with an intensity directly linked to the size of the vehicle that was currently coming towards you, on what you might consider the wrong side of the road).</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9wknYqB7NiQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>The major realisation was that the main Indian road surfaces were a lot better than we had been expecting, at best we'd thought they would be as good as they were in the UK, but what we found was that they were better than that.  With the exception of the odd "Diversion" and some extremely effective speed bumps the roads were brilliantly smooth, making rolling a lot easier than had been expected.</p>

    <p>We stopped for Chai a few times at road side cafes, there was a lot of establishments to choose from, the challenge was finding somewhere we felt confident we wouldn't create a disruption but would also be able to understand what we were looking for.  Not being a tea/coffee drinker I didn't participate in the many discussions on the variety of what was served but my take away was that it was very different to what we call tea back home.</p>
    <p>We arrived in Mathura around afternoon rush hour, there was so much going on it was hard to take it all in. The last few miles made the DVLA's Hazard Perception test look like a lie-in but oddly I felt safer than I do on my regular commute into Belfast. We reached the hotel, fit to collapse and Sam checked us in. First, the all important WiFi details, then began the negotiation on what to do with the bikes, which somehow involved what looked like a chef riding one bike down a slippery slope to a basement car park, but is was eventually agreed we could take them to our rooms and there was time for a quick shower before the 4x4 arrived. Once we'd changed and organised a few things we went on the search for food.  We'd been told the hotel had a sister 300m down the road which had a restaurant, but it was raining and we were tired so we took our first chance to experience the tuc-tuc.  After the initial disappointment of being told the restaurant didn't serve non-veg or alcohol, Gary and Divesh ordered a selection of dishes to the table and we began to sample to my taste bud's delight. When we got back to the hotel I fell asleep quite quickly but woke about 3am, the perfect time for calling home as it turned out!</p>

  <div class="description">
    <p>The day started slightly later as we knew it was going to be a short one, we were up about 8. We went out hunting for breakfast, ordered Buttered Toast and ended up with what looked like a Toasted Sandwich with some sort of cream cheese filling. Breakfast done we were packed and onto the bikes, a short hop down the main road and a little over 2 hours later we were arrving into Agra.  We passed the Red Fort on our way in and headed straight for the Taj Mahal, the first noticeable thing as we turned onto the approach was the complete lack of traffic and horns but as we got closer the crowds began to appear and with them the offers of rickshaw rides, souvenirs, guides and photographers.</p>
    <p>After a brief look round we decided just to head for the hotel, Sam said there was a shortcut and that obviously had to be taken.  What followed was an interesting introduction to the "Villages" of Agra.  They were tight, full of people, animals, motorbikes and other small vehicles.  At times it seemed as though the sewers had burst and were running down the street.  There was a lorry that seemed to have misjudged the width available, an 8 foot ladder being carried on the back of a motorbike and even an english speaking western couple who didn't quite look as lost as we did. Eventually we made it out the other side, and rolled into the hotel.</p>
    <p>Check in complete, WiFi connected, bikes stored, heads showered and clothes changed we headed down to the restaurant for lunch before walking back round to the Taj Mahal (avoiding the shortcut!). It was impressive, though far too much work for my liking.  The guide told us everything we ever wanted to know and more, showed us round the various buildings and took a fair few photos for us.  Most of the people seemed to have come to see the mausoleum, but there was a fair few people asking for selfies with the famous cyclists from the UK! As the sun went down and we made our way back to the hotel the streets came alive with people trying to sell all sorts of trinckets and we soon learnt the lesson if you're going to buy anything be prepared for a bombardment of more people trying to sell you something.</p>

    <p>At 0630 we headed for the breakfast buffet, the choice included porridge, cereal, toast, curry, fruit, yoghurt, chicken sausages, eggs and chapati which set us up nicely for the day.  We packed the bags into the 4x4 and checked out, at which point I noticed my rear tyre was as flat as a pancake, a nice reminder of what we'd ridden through the night before.  10 minutes later, as the sun was beginning to rise, one over size staple had been removed from the tyre, a new tube had been fitted and we were good to go.</p>
    <p>As we left Agra the road was noticeably more rural, away from the road fields stretched for as far as the eye could see, alongside the road villages of houses and small businesses would spring up every now and then, always surrounded by some very uncomfortable speed bumps.  The occasional brick kiln could be seen, a tall chimney surrounded by large piles of bricks either waiting to be dried or waiting for one of the many lorries to come and take them away.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XNt75Ek3TH0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>The route was straight, at times you could see the road stretching into the distance for miles, it made the cycling simple but with a touch of deja-vu at times. As we reached Etawah the road disappeared briefly before taking us into town.  Arriving at the hotel, there was a lot to take in, from the man sat outside with a double barrel shotgun to the guests of a ring ceremony (the end of a multiple day wedding ceremony) coming and going in some exquisite colourful clothing. We checked in, no functional WiFi :-(, and headed to the restaurant to wait for the 4x4 to arrive.</p>
    <p>Next door to the hotel was the first shop I'd recognised as being something akin to a department store.  I was looking for a bag to make keeping kit in the 4x4 simpler and food that I could carry on the bike, I came away with a holdall and 2 multipacks of Hunk bars, obviously guaranteed to improve my appearance over the next few days! After shopping we continued to wander around town and came across what might have been a recreation ground with several games of cricket in progress.  A pile of bricks constituted the wicket, the bats ranged from a well recognised cricket bat to a reasonably straight and thick plank of wood, but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves</p>
    <p>As there wasn't too much appealing on the menu of the hotel restaurant we decided to head out for tea and found the Jayka restaurant, a very nice little restaurant with a non-veg option, where Devish once again ordered a variety of delicious dishes that we dipped into and stocked up on before heading back to the hotel.  On the way back we experienced our first rain of the trip, warm rain in large drops makes a nice change from the cold mizzle I feel I've become accustomed to.  When we arrived back at the hotel, there was a small crowd leaving the wedding ceremony, including one wee boy who's father thought it would be nice to have a photo of his son with the oversized cyclist, the son seemed fine with this until he got to within six inches at which point he screamed, turned and ran.  I can only apologise, must have been the smell!</p>

    <p>With 100 miles planned for the day, we knew it was going to be a tough one. It didn't start so well, having breakfasted and packed the 4x4, we were having issues paying the hotel, they couldn't accept international cards, neither it turned out could several of the cash machines, so the people of Etawah were treated to the sight of an Englishman in cycling kit running around the streets trying to locate a cash machine that would.</p>
    <p>Completely clear skies meant it was a warm one, with very little respite.  The highlight of the day, and possibly the trip for me was when the 4x4 pulled alongside with the window wound down and Devish leant out to hand out a bar of Toblerone.  The pain suddenly seemed insignificant, the monotony was gone, the taste of plastic in the mouth replaced with delicious honey and almond and a slight concern in my head, "How much of this should I share?!"</p>

    <p>We were heading for Kanpur, the largest city we would be cycling through in Uttar Pradesh, and we'd been told it was once known as the Manchester of India, so we were on the look out for a football stadium or two and plenty of rain.  When we reached it Kanpur was busy, it took a good 45 minutes to ride the 8 miles or so from the outskirts to our fairly central hotel</p>

    Got turned away at FabHotel Travellers Inn (No Foreigners)
    <p>We were staying in the suburbs of Lucknow, an area called Gomti Nagar, it was the first place I really noticed the immediate juxtoposition of the life of the wealthy and poor.  The hotel we ended up staying in was a few hundred metres away from a shopping mall, with a Dominos on the front porch, a large supermarket and a handful of nice looking outlets selling everything from bikes to clothes to massages.  Next door and across the road was an area of dwellings constructed from materials that looked like they had been scavenged to create whatever shelter they could provide.</p>
    <p>Pizza Hut for lunch, Dehydration, Shopping, Novotel for tea</p>
