<h1>The Ride Against Traffik</h1>
<div class="intro">
  <p>In February 2019, 4 of us travelled from London to Delhi to join the Viva team and begin the challenge of riding one of the major traffiking routes, against the flow of young girls being bought and sold between Kathmandu and Delhi. The aim of the challenge, to raise awareness and <a href="https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/TimMullender" >funds</a> to help Viva in preventing the traffik and restoring the lives of those involved.</p>

    <p>We arrived in Delhi around 9am, Gary met us at the airport with Nirendra, the driver and the 4x4 that was to be our transport for the fortnight.  We wheeled the luggage out to the car park, located the vehicle and started to workout how to get everything in. Magically 3 or 4 men appeared, who seemed to profess some level of expertise in loading vehicles, offering their assistance and within 10 minutes it was established that the bikes would fit in with Gary and Nirendra and the four of us would get a taxi to the hotel.The taxi was a squeeze, but it was only a 40 minute drive and a good introduction to the roads of Delhi</p>
    <p> I don&#39;t think more than 30 seconds passed without hearing a car horn the whole time we were in Delhi.  We arrived at the hotel a bit tired and, as only one room was available initially, set about reconstructing the bikes. There had only been one minor issue in transit, Dave&#39;s bike had arrived with a broken QR skewer, thankfully we had a spare so after a couple of hours of assembling and checking we were good to go.Our rooms were ready just in time for a quick shower, a bite to eat and then we got to meet some of the Viva team in India.</p>
    <p>Viva India had been spending the last few days in the hotel getting together the leaders from the various centres around India to discuss strategy and encourage each other.  They spent about an hour telling us about each of the regions they worked in and the many ways in which they were helping children in those areas, it was good to hear the great work they are doing. After the session there was time for a quick but necessary snooze before heading out for tea with some of the Viva team.  We headed to a restaurant round the corner from the hotel, where they proceeded to repeatedly bring delicious food and place it on our plates for at least 20 minutes before telling us that was just the starter and the main course was a buffet so we could help ourselves. Needless to say I think I stocked up well for the next day. When we finally made it back to the hotel and into bed I think I was asleep in seconds.</p>

    <p>The alarms went off soon after 5am, showers were had, sun cream was applied, cycling kit was donned and bags were packed. Rooms were emptied, breakfast was eaten, the vehicle was packed and bikes were readied, all before 6am (mostly).  The plan was to be out of Delhi before the traffic got bad, so shortly before 7, after a prayer and a goodbye from the members of the Viva team that were awake, Gary led the way out of the hotel parking area onto the road.</p>

    <p>We waited for the 4x4 to catch up before winding our way on to the main road that would take us out of Delhi, the sun was just starting to rise and the city was starting to come to life. Nervousness was the pervasive feeling, unknown roads, unknown rules and an unknown destination with the added thought of only having put the bikes together a few hours earlier on very little sleep made the intial miles somewhat tentative.</p>
    <p>We very quickly had to adapt to the "rules" of the road, for me that could be summed up by "Don't hit what's in front of you and what's behind you will take care of itself", it lead to one of the more memorable phrases from the trip "Incoming!" (said with an intensity directly linked to the size of the vehicle that was currently coming towards you, on what you might consider the wrong side of the road).</p>

    <p>The major realisation was that the main Indian road surfaces were a lot better than we had been expecting, at best we'd thought they would be as good as they were in the UK, but what we found was that they were better than that.  With the exception of the odd "Diversion" and some extremely effective speed bumps the roads were brilliantly smooth, making rolling a lot easier than had been expected.</p>

    <p>We stopped for Chai a few times at road side cafes, there was a lot of establishments to choose from, the challenge was finding somewhere we felt confident we wouldn't create a disruption but would also be able to understand what we were looking for.  Not being a tea/coffee drinker I didn't participate in the many discussions on the variety of what was served but my take away was that it was very different to what we call tea back home.</p>
    <p>We arrived in Mathura around afternoon rush hour, there was so much going on it was hard to take it all in. The last few miles made the DVLA's Hazard Perception test look like a lie-in but oddly I felt safer than I do on my regular commute into Belfast. We reached the hotel, fit to collapse and Sam checked us in. First, the all important WiFi details, then began the negotiation on what to do with the bikes, which somehow involved what looked like a chef riding one bike down a slippery slope to a basement car park, but is was eventually agreed we could take them to our rooms and there was time for a quick shower before the 4x4 arrived. Once we'd changed and organised a few things we went on the search for food.  We'd been told the hotel had a sister 300m down the road which had a restaurant, but it was raining and we were tired so we took our first chance to experience the tuc-tuc.  After the initial disappointment of being told the restaurant didn't serve non-veg or alcohol, Gary and Divesh ordered a selection of dishes to the table and we began to sample to my taste bud's delight. When we got back to the hotel I fell asleep quite quickly but woke about 3am, the perfect time for calling home as it turned out!</p>

    <p>The day started slightly later as we knew it was going to be a short one, we were up about 8. We went out hunting for breakfast, ordered Buttered Toast and ended up with what looked like a Toasted Sandwich with some sort of cream cheese filling. Breakfast done we were packed and onto the bikes, a short hop down the main road and a little over 2 hours later we were arrving into Agra.  We passed the Red Fort on our way in and headed straight for the Taj Mahal, the first noticeable thing as we turned onto the approach was the complete lack of traffic and horns but as we got closer the crowds began to appear and with them the offers of rickshaw rides, souvenirs, guides and photographers.</p>
    <p>After a brief look round we decided just to head for the hotel, Sam said there was a shortcut and that obviously had to be taken.  What followed was an interesting introduction to the "Villages" of Agra.  They were tight, full of people, animals, motorbikes and other small vehicles.  At times it seemed as though the sewers had burst and were running down the street.  There was a lorry that seemed to have misjudged the width available, an 8 foot ladder being carried on the back of a motorbike and even an english speaking western couple who didn't quite look as lost as we did. Eventually we made it out the other side, and rolled into the hotel.</p>
    <p>Check in complete, WiFi connected, bikes stored, heads showered and clothes changed we headed down to the restaurant for lunch before walking back round to the Taj Mahal (avoiding the shortcut!). It was impressive, though far too much work for my liking.  The guide told us everything we ever wanted to know and more, showed us round the various buildings and took a fair few photos for us.  Most of the people seemed to have come to see the mausoleum, but there was a fair few people asking for selfies with the famous cyclists from the UK! As the sun went down and we made our way back to the hotel the streets came alive with people trying to sell all sorts of trinckets and we soon learnt the lesson if you're going to buy anything be prepared for a bombardment of more people trying to sell you something.</p>

    <p>At 0630 we headed for the breakfast buffet, the choice included porridge, cereal, toast, curry, fruit, yoghurt, chicken sausages, eggs and chapati which set us up nicely for the day.  We packed the bags into the 4x4 and checked out, at which point I noticed my rear tyre was as flat as a pancake, a nice reminder of what we'd ridden through the night before.  10 minutes later, as the sun was beginning to rise, one over size staple had been removed from the tyre, a new tube had been fitted and we were good to go.</p>
    <p>As we left Agra the road was noticeably more rural, away from the road fields stretched for as far as the eye could see, alongside the road villages of houses and small businesses would spring up every now and then, always surrounded by some very uncomfortable speed bumps.  The occasional brick kiln could be seen, a tall chimney surrounded by large piles of bricks either waiting to be dried or waiting for one of the many lorries to come and take them away.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XNt75Ek3TH0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>The route was straight, at times you could see the road stretching into the distance for miles, it made the cycling simple but with a touch of deja-vu at times. As we reached Etawah the road disappeared briefly before taking us into town.  Arriving at the hotel, there was a lot to take in, from the man sat outside with a double barrel shotgun to the guests of a ring ceremony (the end of a multiple day wedding ceremony) coming and going in some exquisite colourful clothing. We checked in, no functional WiFi :-(, and headed to the restaurant to wait for the 4x4 to arrive.</p>
    <p>Next door to the hotel was the first shop I'd recognised as being something akin to a department store.  I was looking for a bag to make keeping kit in the 4x4 simpler and food that I could carry on the bike, I came away with a holdall and 2 multipacks of Hunk bars, obviously guaranteed to improve my appearance over the next few days! After shopping we continued to wander around town and came across what might have been a recreation ground with several games of cricket in progress.  A pile of bricks constituted the wicket, the bats ranged from a well recognised cricket bat to a reasonably straight and thick plank of wood, but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves</p>
    <p>As there wasn't too much appealing on the menu of the hotel restaurant we decided to head out for tea and found the Jayka restaurant, a very nice little restaurant with a non-veg option, where Devesh once again ordered a variety of delicious dishes that we dipped into and stocked up on before heading back to the hotel.  On the way back we experienced our first rain of the trip, warm rain in large drops makes a nice change from the cold mizzle I feel I've become accustomed to.  When we arrived back at the hotel, there was a small crowd leaving the wedding ceremony, including one wee boy who's father thought it would be nice to have a photo of his son with the oversized cyclist, the son seemed fine with this until he got to within six inches at which point he screamed, turned and ran.  I can only apologise, must have been the smell!</p>

    <p>With 100 miles planned for the day, we knew it was going to be a tough one. It didn't start so well, having breakfasted and packed the 4x4, we were having issues paying the hotel, they couldn't accept international cards, neither it turned out could several of the cash machines, so the people of Etawah were treated to the sight of an Englishman in cycling kit running around the streets trying to locate a cash machine that would.</p>
    <p>Completely clear skies meant it was a warm one, with very little respite.  The highlight of the day, and possibly the trip for me was when the 4x4 pulled alongside with the window wound down and Devesh leant out to hand out a bar of Toblerone.  The pain suddenly seemed insignificant, the monotony was gone, the taste of plastic in the mouth replaced with delicious honey and almond and a slight concern in my head, "How much of this should I share?!".</p>

    <p>We were heading for Kanpur, the largest city we would be cycling through in Uttar Pradesh, and we'd been told it was once known as the Manchester of India, so we were on the look out for a football stadium or two and plenty of rain.  When we reached it Kanpur was busy, it took a good 45 minutes to ride the 8 miles or so from the outskirts to our fairly central hotel. By the end of the day, my double layer of sun cream had burnt off and most of us were left with a nice warm red glow.</p>

    <p>Following my roughest night of the trip, the day's ride started with the crossing of the Ganges, there'd been thoughts of going for a dip but it didn't happen.  There was an archway either end of the bridge and alongside each arch there was what appeared to be a 4 foot high pile of fruit, that the local animals seemed to be helping themselves to.</p>
    <p>For fear of further sunburn I started the day with both my arm warmers and leg warmers on, it would have probably have been an odd sight if it wasn't for the fact that we already appeared to be the oddest sight most people had seen in a while.  Most days along the ride people would slow down when passing, some would try and hold a conversation, though our Hindi was limited to counting to seven, and quite a few would take a photos or selfies.  It's still a wonder to me that with the number of guys we saw riding their motorbikes along a main highway while trying to take a selfie with us in the frame, none of them even came close to crashing.</p>
    <p>We had the wind behind us most of the day and with only 60 miles to cover on some very nice roads we were able to make pretty good time, we took the bypass around Lucknow to avoid the fun we had experienced riding through the centre of Kanpur and for most of it we were comfortably sitting at 20mph, we could only hope that would continue</p>
    <p>We were staying in the suburbs of Lucknow, an area called Gomti Nagar, it was the first place I really noticed the immediate juxtaposition of the life of the wealthy and the poor.  We got turned away from the hotel we had planned to stay at, for anyone wondering the FabHotel Travellers Inn in Gomti Nagar doesn't accept foreigners, despite what booking.com might lead you to believe! The hotel we ended up staying in was a few hundred metres away from a shopping mall, with a Dominos on the front porch, a large supermarket and a handful of nice looking outlets selling everything from bikes to clothes to massages.  Next door and across the road was an area with shacks constructed from materials that looked like they had been scavenged to create whatever shelter they could provide.</p>
    <p>By the time we arrived at the hotel I was significantly dehydrated and exhausted. Between the hotel, a Pizza Hut lunch and a trip to the shopping mall's supermarket I managed to consume 6 litres of fluid before we headed out to find tea at the rooftop bar of the relatively fancy Novotel hotel down the road, feeling slightly more alive.</p>

    <p>The longest day.  120 miles, we'd planned to break it down into 3 lots of 40 miles, a mid morning break after 40 miles, a lunch stop after 80 and then the last leg into Basti.  It pretty much went to plan, apart from a slight misunderstanding with the guys in the 4x4 who went to find lunch in Faizabad, which was psychologically too earlier for some of us.  The Hotel Yuvraj Palace was then found, and at 86 miles in, it was deemed perfect for a lunch stop.</p>

    <p>We soon arrived into Basti and with another shortcut, which this time turned out to be cobbled, we arrived at the Hotel Shivay Palace feeling quite pleased with ourselves.  Sam went into sort check in, and the rest of attempted to field the questions from the gathering crowd outside, including one young teenager who told us it was his dream to meet and talk to someone from the UK, we like to make dreams come true.</p>

    <p>Sam soon reappeared with the news that for the second night in a row the hotel wasn't prepared to accept us, not quite what was needed with 120 miles in the legs, but a bit of googling, a call to Gary and a discussion with the crowd around us and we were soon arriving at the next hotel.  No Wifi, no restaurant, no check in without a passport but it was a bed and that was all we needed.</p>
    <p>We headed down the road to find tea and met what felt like a cross between Las Vegas and Bollywood, but was a very bright and colourful wedding in full swing, there were three of them in the short walk between the hotel and the restaurant. It felt a litlle how I would imagine a celebrity would feel arriving at a party, with lots of people milling around taking photos, fireworks going off and lots of load music and bright lights.</p>
    <p>We had a nice meal at the Red Chilli Restaurant, before heading back to the hotel and bed</p>

    <p>The last day in India, the plan had been to ride about 60 miles to the border, get through immigration and then a couple more miles to the hotel.  Gary had started early to get a headstart, as he had for the last few days, he phoned to say the planned route had very little of what could be called road and we might be better taking an alternate route.  A quick check of the map suggested we could head via Gorakhpur, a route that would give us a chance to meet some of Devesh's family.  A rough estimate from "someone" suggested it would only be an extra 10 miles and we agreed to give it a go and set off.  By this time we were already an hour later than planned and we hadn't got very far before we reached a level crossing and had to wait a further 20 minutes for the train to pass.</p>

    <p>Once we were out of Basti we set a reasonably good pace to Gorakhpur, we stopped for a short relief before heading into Gorakhpur and my head had 2 minutes to do some maths, we'd already covered almost 40 miles and we weren't even half way. That extra 10 miles was now seeming a little bit short.  Traffic in Gorakhpur was slow, and we were stuck to the 4x4 as Devesh was leading the way to meet his family, it took around 45 minutes to make it through and out onto the road towards the border where we were to meet them.  We were soon spotted, Devesh's wife and three daughters and 1yr old grandson were there to say Hello and bring supplies of chocolate - always the perfect gift.  We took the chance to grab some lunch and take in the situation, it was 1430, we had about 60 miles to go, plus exiting India and Immigration in Nepal, it would be dark about 1800 and only two of us had lights.  The mission was clear.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qilW9qRs548" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>We set off again, once out of Gorakhpur the rain started to fall, mud from the road was spraying everywhere but that didn't deter us, 2.5 mile turns on the front were suggested and we lined out like we were in a pursuit.  Devesh kept us supplied with the newly acquired chocolate and bananas for those that wanted them.  We reached the border just before 1730, job well done so far. Indian Immigration turned out to be a small single room building on the side of the road, we missed it initially but thanks to some helpful people at the side of the road had not gone too far past.  The queue was not too long but the level of enthusiasm behind the counter meant it felt a lot slower than it was, we were on our way again within 15 minutes and into Nepal.</p>
    <p>Nepali immigration was a little more painful, there were forms to be filled in, two of them with 90% of the information duplicated, fees had to be paid in cash, thankfully Roger was stocked up on US dollars, there was only one pen between the five of us so it took a while.  It was just getting dark by the time everyone had a stamp and we were on our way.  Thankfully there were only 3 miles to go, we shared the lights out so those at the back had rear lights and the one front light was at the front.  I'd not got more than 100 metres down the road when I tried to make my way slowly through a stream/puddle that I thought was only an inch or two deep, my back wheel sank at least 6 inches and I came to an abrupt stop before falling to my left. It was too dark to assess the damage and the hotel was nearby so we kept going, it took us a few minutes to find the entrance in the dark but eventually we made it.</p>
    <p>The hotel weren't happy for us to take our bikes to our rooms and said we could leave them with the security guard, by this time no-one was really in the mood to argue so left them we did and I headed to my room to have a shower and apply Iodine liberally to my knee. Tea was a celebratory affair in the hotel restaurant, we'd made it to Nepal and the rest day was only one day away.</p>

    <p>A sound nights sleep, a bit of a lie in, another good breakfast buffet with pancakes and syrup and the thougt that we only had to get through the day before we had a rest day, all meant that we set off in good spirits.  The first thing that was immediately noticable was that the roads were not as smooth as they had been on previous days.  More akin to country roads in the UK, we had been spoilt while riding through India and it made the first few miles a little more uncomfortable.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tIqq6J0JB8I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>The next realisation was that the landscape was not as flat either, in the distance we could see the mountains looming and it wasn't long before they soon got a good bit closer.  We hit the first climb about 25 miles in, the summit was at 500m so we only had about 400 metres to climb, but it was enough to take the speed down to a walking pace in places. With lorries going even slower than we were and overtaking being done regardless of blind corners you had to keep your head up but some of the views were amazing.  We eventually made the top and regrouped before starting the descent on the other side.  It was fast, twisty and bumpy, very bumpy.  The addition, on the descent, of a political promotion vehicle, blasting the same 20s track of load music repeatedly prompted some bold overtaking moves but we made it down in one piece with only one venture onto the opposing verge.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oZ-KjorxjbU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>The rest of the day was rolling hills, small villages and bridges over dried river beds.  Trying to carry as much speed as possible from one descent into the next climb but with plenty of other road users to dodge and a fair few pot holes it was tough going.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/09hL87eBZZo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>We stopped for lunch at a small hotel/cafe, where we managed to communicate our need for water and Sprite and played safe with a plate of chips each.  It wasn't too long after lunch that we reached Chitwan, passing through the forest with pictures of tigers and rhinos on the side of the road, I wasn't sure whether I wanted to see one at that point or not, I was reasonably sure I didn't have the legs left to outrun either!</p>
    <p>Eventually we were off the main road and winding our way towards our accomodation for the next two nights, we spotted elephants getting washed and fed just before we arrived.  Again the bikes weren't allowed in our rooms, again we didn't have too much energy for debating it.  We checked in, showered and headed for an early evening dip in the swimming pool, it wasn't quite an ice bath but it was certainly heading that way, perfect for muscle recovery.  Bathed, we headed to the bar, and then the restaurant for tea before bed.</p>

    <p>I missed breakfast as I'd had a rough night, with an hour or two spent trying to unblock the appliance, but once I was on the bike I didn't feel too bad.  The first 10 miles, out of Chitwan, were the same roads we'd arrived on 36 hours earlier. It was slightly weird riding roads we'd already ridden, it started to feel like we knew the place.  We soon turned to follow the river though and the next 45 miles were rolling hills surrounded by mountains with breathtaking views of the water below.  The sun was shining and the sky was mostly cloudless, the day off had given the bodies a good rest and it felt good to be back on the bike again.</p>

    <p>The traffic was heavier than it had been for most of the trip, it turns out that the road was only real main road between Kathmamdu and the main industrial area, so it felt like every other vehicle was a truck, we were frequently passing one on a climb or catching it on a descent only for it to pass us again once the road had flattened out a bit.  The only other worry was the speed bumps, around three sets of three small bumps before and after each bridge or narrow section of the road, at speed you could just about hop them but get it wrong and they gave you a good shake.</p>

    <p>The river wound it's way through the valley and split occasionally, surrounded by villages with the odd tourist hotel.  There were quite a few bridges of varying degrees of width, one or two I wouldn't have been sending the kids over.</p>

    <p>The accomodation for the night was a little hard to spot as the land dropped away from the road quite steeply in places, we were staying in bamboo huts on the edge of the river.  There was white water running past the resort and, after a freezing cold shower, I spent most of the afternoon sat in the shade on the edge of the river listening to the water rushing past.  We had tea at the restaurant, before wrapping up warm and heading for bed.</p>

    <p>After a suprisingly good nights sleep, we woke to face the last day with a little trepidation, The final challenge would be 48 miles, with the first 35 being a gradually steepening climb to around 1500 metres, followed by a descent into Kathmandu.  We were on the road before 0730 in the hope of finishing the climb before the sun got too high, to start with the hills were fairly rolling and quiet so we were able to carry speed down one and up the next, but the roads got busier and the climbs got bigger, eventually we were down to a walking pace again.</p>

    <p>We stopped for some food just before 12 on the umpteenth hairpin bend, as we stopped and looked up you could see where the road went over the saddle, in some ways it was a relief to see the top, but at the same time you could see that there was still quite a way to go. We weren't too far from the top when you could see eagles circling just off the edge of the road, gliding on the currents, making the whole thing look effortless compared to the slog of climbing</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ut16Fe5R_cw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>We reached the top and regrouped, there was now only a little over 10 miles to go, it was almost all downhill, it was time to enjoy the last few minutes...  It turned out that the road surafce only lasted a mile or two before it turned into gravel, gravel that threw up a whole load of dust, at times visibility dropped to about 30 metres, I watched a bus appear out of the dirt, coming towards me and realised it wasn't going to be a comfortable ride in.  As we got closer to the city centre the road surface improved but the traffic got heavier.</p>
    <p>The final few corners turned, we arrived at the hotel, the challenge was complete. We were met by the most jovial member of staff of the whole trip, nothing seemed to be too much to ask.  At one point, he was stood, dressed in a shirt and smart trousers, getting splashed with mud as he proceeded to wash the dust off my bike.</p>
    <p>Having packed the bikes away and showered, I took a short walk around the block before we met for food in the restaurant across the road from the hotel.  Carnet (part of the Viva network in Nepal) were coming to meet us at 5, our food had only just arrived by then, so we downed it quickly and made our way back to the hotel.  We had a quick briefing on the projects Carnet were involved in and they very kindly presented us with some awards for completing the challenge, a quick prayer and a chat and they were on their way back across Kathmandu and we were on our way to Sam's bar for a drink</p>
